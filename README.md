Open Planet Maps
================

The project should be treated as being in an alpha state.

The current aim of the project is to build a map server dedicated to
providing map layers for the surfaces of known astral bodies, such as
the Sun, the planets and the various non-man-made satellites. 

The data the project depends on should be of an open nature, whether
that is public domain, creative commons or an alternative license that
allows use in a non-commercial context.

The current design assumption of the project is to provide a collection
of JSON files that indicate the location of the source map data, along
suitable metadata and then have a script that fetches the source map
data and then via a script prepare the content for distribution.

This is still very much a work in progress and not ready for deployment.

But Google...
-------------

The comparison should be more to OpenStreetMap and not Google Map, but for
other astral bodies. The idea is create an open platform that anyone in the
community can benefit from, and contribute to. We may not all be scientists,
but to get people engaged and interested is important. Part of that is by
reducing the barrier of entry to the data that is already out there and another
part is allowing anyone to contribute to improving what is to improve what is
already there.

The current philosophy is to be agnostic from any hosting platform, but eventually
we foresee scripts to allow you deploy to the platform of your choice.

Installation
------------
