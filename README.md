The current aim of the project is to build a map server dedicated to providing map
layers for the surfaces of known astral bodies, such as the sun, the planets and
the various non-man made satellites. 

The data the project depends on should be of an open nature, whether that is public
domain, creative commons or an alternative license that allows use in a non-commercial
context.

The current design assumption of the project is to provide a collection of JSON files that indicate the location of the source map data, along suitable metadata and then
have a script that fetches the source map data and then via a script prepare the
content for distribution.

This is still very much a work in progress and not ready for deployment.
